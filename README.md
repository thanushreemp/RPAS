# RPAS

# Remotely Piloted Aerial System with Defence Mechanism
## Project Overview
This project involves the design and development of a remotely piloted aerial system (RPAS) equipped with a defence mechanism. The UAV is designed for precision-guided strikes and is controlled remotely from a ground control station. This system integrates advanced sensors, secure communication protocols, and a user-friendly web interface to enhance operational efficiency for various security and emergency response applications.

## Features
Precision-Guided Strike System: Equipped with modern weaponry for accurate target engagement.
Advanced Sensors: Integrated cameras, radar, and GPS for comprehensive situational awareness.
Secure Communication: Developed to ensure reliable and secure data transmission between the UAV and ground control station.
Web Interface: User-friendly web application for easy UAV control and monitoring.
